# Basic Methods Practice

You're job over break is to build these methods as they are described. Spread them out, you have 14 days off and 10 practice methods to write. Look at the example for where to write your method in relation to each prompt.

Minimal practice over break - spend 1 hour on this challenge every third day. This is to keep your brains active - If you don't practice over break, you will lose many of the skills you've collected. It's up to you to not let that information go away.
